From bugfix 1.1 to release 2.0:

Additions:
- Added various comments for documentation

- The user join message is now a configurable setting

Changes:
- Compacted single-line if statements
- Help text is now cached in a file, instead of just being in the program, and checks GitHub to see if a newer version is availiable
- The copy- and paste-able emoticons are now shown by "page", and can now also be inserted into the user's chat by shift-clicking
- The time between users being able to use ChatCommands has been changed from 10 seconds down to 1 second
- Changed auto-restart countdown to 3 seconds, down from 5 seconds

Optimizations:
- Optimized the pad0s function's "round" function
- Some configurations (emoticons and user join messages) now have the defaults stored on GitHub intead of in the code
- Optimized the profanity checker so that it only checks chat messages, instead of wasting time checking everything

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a logging bug
- Fixed a bug where user join messages wouldn't be shown
- Fixed a bug where console commands entered by users would be saved as /say messages in logs
- Fixed a bug where the ChatCommand spam protection wouldn't work, because it checked if the last time the user used a command was "-1" to see if they were an admin, and the default value is set to "-1"
- Fixed a bug where ChatCommand help would not show properly if executed from the console
- Fixed a bug where the server couldn't start if there was no server properties file
