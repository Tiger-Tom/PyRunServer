From QOL 3.1 to release 4.0

Additions:
- Major:
  - Added a wiki (https://github.com/Tiger-Tom/RunServerDotPy/wiki)
  - Added mod reloader command
  - Added commands to display links to go to RS.PY's Github page and Wiki
  - Added a web interface

- Minor:
  - Added protections for "speedtest" command failing
  - TPS test command now actually shows something when it can't be run due to being ran to recently, before it just did nothing


Changes:
- Major:
  - ChatCommands are "selected" in a different way - using the new "case-match" system in Python 3.10
  - A lot of ChatCommands were also rewritten and maybe optimized
  - ~~Cleaned up modloader function a bit~~ Completely overhauled the modloading system
  - Modding can now have custom runtimes - functions that run at certain times. Current times are firstStart, everyStart, lastStop, and everyStop
  - Help text version checker now fingerprints both the current version and the (potentially newer) online version and compares them, instead of relying on cached help version data
- Minor:
  - Uptime command now shows in seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks format
  - Cleaned up imports section & grouped similar imports further

Removals:
- Major:
  - Removed the antivirus scan command and the update/upgrade command
- Minor:
  - Removed some chat and console spam
  - Removed some unusable features
  - Removed battery sensor for sysinfo command

Bugfixes:
- Major:
  - Emoticon page menu now suggests text to run command instead of running a "/tag" command to set a flag, as this doesn't actually work without OP
  - Tellraw functions fixed ("safeTellRaw" function specifically)
  - Fixed an issue with the time calculations for "uptime" by replacing time.monotonic() with time.time()
  - Fixed an issue where modules would be installed in the wrong version if "pip3" didn't correspond to the correct Python version
  - Fixed an issue where "requests" module wasn't in the "non-standard" group that would be automatically installed if they were missing (I thought that that was build-in...)

- Minor:
  - Fixed a bug which would cause the "sysinfo" command to still check for battery(when it still existed)/temperature, even if these don't actually exist, therefore causing an exception
  - Fixed an issue where an exception would be displayed in console if ";sudo" or ";root" was entered without any commands
  - Fixed an issue where some outputs of the sysinfo command were being broadcast to all user and some weren't. Now all of them just go to the target user

- Typo/misspelling:
  - Fixed a misspelling that caused a log's start time to be "Y%" instead of STRFTimed "%Y"
  - Fixed an issue where the help menu for sudo commands would show ";sudo[command]" without spacing upon hovering over or inserting a command, instead of ";sudo [command]"
